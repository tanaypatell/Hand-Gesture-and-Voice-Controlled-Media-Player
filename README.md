# Hand-Gesture-and-Voice-Controlled-Media-Player
Designed a user-friendly website that responds to hand gestures and voice commands to help people with disabilities navigate the system and control the media player. I was responsible for developing the hand gesture model using Python's Mediapipe library and integrating it into the website using the Flask Framework. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was used to construct the website's front-end, and voice commands were integrated into the website with the Annyang JavaScript module.
